# Pong- It's pong in python!

The rules are simple: try to score in the AI's goal while still defending yours. 
After each goal there will be a three second countdwon before play resumes. 
Each goal is worth only one point.
The first to seven wins. (There is currently no way to stop the game once someone hits 7, currently working on that bug)
